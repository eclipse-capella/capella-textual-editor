=Introduction=

Textual Scenario Editor is an addon that allows to edit Capella Scenarios in textual mode. The addon allows the user to use a simple language to write the scenarios in textual mode and enables two-way synchronization between the textual scenario and the diagram.

===Features introduced in Textual Scenario Editor===

* Simple language based on Capella semantic with a mapping as close as possible with PlantUML in order to import later PlantUML scripts within Capella
* Textual edition of Capella scenarios
* Propose auto-completion (CTRL+Space) of Capella elements.
* Textual edition managing error detection (e.i invalid Capella model: e.g. non existing target role of specified lifeline)
* Synchronization between textual edition and scenario display
